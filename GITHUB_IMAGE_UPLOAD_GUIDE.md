## üîÑ Updating Gallery Data After Upload

After uploading images, update the gallery data file:

### File: `shared/gallery.ts`

```typescript
// Add more images to the existing event:
{
  id: 'sk25-009',
  url: '/assets/images/swagatam-krishna-25/img-009.jpg',
  caption: 'Description of the photo',
  photographer: 'Photographer Name',
  date: '2025-01-15'
}
```

### For New Events:
Create a new event object with all your uploaded images:

```typescript
{
  id: 'new-event-2025',
  name: 'New Event Name',
  date: '2025-02-15',
  description: 'Event description',
  type: 'festival',
  coverImage: '/assets/images/new-event-2025/cover.jpg',
  featured: true,
  images: [
    {
      id: 'ne25-001',
      url: '/assets/images/new-event-2025/img-001.jpg',
      caption: 'Photo description',
      photographer: 'Photographer Name',
      date: '2025-02-15'
